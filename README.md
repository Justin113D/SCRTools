# Welcome to SCRTools!
These are the open source tools that were developed (mostly by me, **Justin113D**) for the **Sonic Chronicles Reimagined fangame project**. <br/>
Due to how these tools were set up, they are **not limited to SCR**, and as such were made open source in the first place! <br/>
That way other project devs, may they be **other fan-projects or full Indie-titles**, can use these programs to assist in development. <br/>
<br/>
**Do not worry about crediting**, as these programs perform the most basic/general tasks (such as the language editor). <br/>
**Everyone is free to use these tools as they please! ^^** <br/>

# The tools
## The Language editor
A program in which devs can create a template/format, which translators can then use to translate the texts in the editor

### The language tester
An example program. It's made to show how to use the .lang and .langkey files in your games/software!
